                    <h2>1. Environmental Impacts</h2>
                  
                    <p>
                        <strong>Water Scarcity-</strong> In some regions, rivers are drying up. Why? Because the water
                        is being used faster than nature
                        can replace it often to grow cotton or feed livestock for global consumption.
                    </p><br>

                    <p><strong>Ecosystem Damage-</strong>
                        When wetlands shrink or disappear, species that depended on them vanish too. What seems like
                        "just water" is actually someone’s
                        entire habitat. In some farming areas, the soil is now so salty from over-irrigation, nothing
                        grows anymore. It’s like slow poisoning of
                        the Earth’s
                        skin.
                    </p><br>

                    <p><strong>Pollution-</strong>
                        Water bodies are turning toxic. Pollutants from industries, especially textile and food
                        processing, flow untreated into rivers
                        and into our ecosystems.
                        Algae blooms from fertilizers choke lakes and ponds. They may look green, but they’re killing
                        everything beneath.
                    </p><br>

                <!-- Social Impact Card -->
                    <h2>2. Social Impacts</h2>

                    <p><strong>Inequality in Access-</strong>
                        In rural India or sub-Saharan Africa, families sometimes walk miles for a few liters of water
                        while bottled water factories nearby
                        consume millions of liters a day.
                        It’s not just unfair. it’s heartbreaking. Industries take what locals need to survive.
                    </p><br>


                    <p><strong>Health at Risk-</strong>
                        When the local pond is contaminated, where do people drink from? Often, they don’t have a choice
                        and diseases follow.
                        Children get sick. Mothers worry. But the pollution continues.
                    </p><br>

                    <p><strong>Food Security-</strong>
                        With less water to grow crops, farming families lose their income and their meals. Food prices
                        rise. Hunger spreads.
                    </p><br>

                    <p><strong>Costs Rising-</strong>
                        In areas with water stress, companies now spend more on water treatment, access, and logistics.
                        These costs trickle down to us.
                        Some businesses are even relocating due to water shortages. It's that serious.
                    </p><br>

                    <p><strong>Agricultural Impact-</strong>
                        Farmers are on the front lines. When water sources dry up or soil becomes unusable, they can’t
                        grow food. Not for their family, nor
                        for the market.
                        High water-demand crops like sugarcane, rice, or cotton bring quick profit but long-term harm.
                        We need smarter choices.

                    <h2>4. Climate Change & Water</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Droughts & Floods-</strong> Irregular rains and water stress are already displacing
                        communities. It's happening right now,
                        not in some distant future.<br><br>
                        <strong>Energy Crisis-</strong> Power plants, coal-based ones, rely heavily on water. As rivers
                        shrink, power supply
                        becomes unstable affecting homes and hospitals.

                <div class="impact-card" id="textile">
                    <p>
                        Every time you buy a T-shirt or a pair of jeans, you're not just buying clothes you're also
                        unknowingly consuming thousands of liters of water. The textile industry, though often
                        overlooked, is one of the biggest contributors to global water stress. Here's why that matters
                        more than most people realize.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>1. Cotton Production</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cotton may feel soft and harmless, but its water demand is staggering. It’s the most widely used
                        fiber in the textile world, yet also one of the thirstiest.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>To grow enough cotton for just one T-shirt, it takes around <strong>2,700 liters of
                                water</strong>. That’s nearly what a person drinks in three years.</li>
                        <li>Most of this water is used for irrigation especially in regions already struggling with
                            low rainfall and groundwater depletion.</li>
                        <li>Globally, the cotton industry is responsible for about <strong>3% of the total water
                                footprint</strong>. On paper, it may sound small but the sheer volume of cotton grown
                            worldwide turns that number into a massive environmental cost.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h2>2. Dyeing and Finishing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once the fabric is made, the water problem doesn’t end it intensifies. The dyeing and
                        finishing process turns clean water into toxic waste in many manufacturing hubs.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It takes roughly <strong>100 to 150 liters of water</strong> to dye a single kilogram of
                            fabric. For some fabrics, the number can go up to <strong>200 liters</strong>.</li>
                        <li>But the issue isn't just quantity it’s also the quality of what’s left behind. Many
                            factories release wastewater directly into rivers without treatment, contaminating water
                            used by communities and ecosystems downstream.</li>
                        <li>Textile dyeing is responsible for up to <strong>20% of global industrial
                                pollution</strong>. That means one-fifth of polluted industrial water comes from our
                            clothes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h2>3. Global Water Footprint of Textiles</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you zoom out, the numbers become even harder to ignore. The textile industry uses enough
                        water annually to fill tens of millions of Olympic-size swimming pools.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Estimates suggest the industry consumes around <strong>93 billion cubic meters of water each
                                year</strong>.</li>
                        <li>The total water footprint for producing <strong>just 1 kilogram of textiles</strong> can
                            exceed <strong>30,000 liters</strong>, depending on the material and processes involved.
                        </li>
                        <li>For reference: that’s more water than an average household uses in a month all for a piece
                            of clothing.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><i>
                            When buying your next piece of clothing, pause and ask how much water did this cost the
                            planet? Because the impact is not just hidden in supply chains it’s also hidden in plain
                            sight.</i>

                    <p>
                        Ever thought about how much water your food consumes before it even reaches your plate?
                        From growing crops to packaging processed meals the water toll is massive.
                        And in a world facing water scarcity, it's a toll we can’t afford to ignore.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>1. Water Use in Agriculture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Food starts in the fields, and that’s where the biggest gulp of water happens.
                        Some everyday staples use surprisingly large volumes of freshwater:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rice:</strong> ~2,500 liters of water per kg (due to flooded paddy fields)</li>
                        <li><strong>Wheat & Corn:</strong> ~1,600 liters/kg</li>
                        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> A staggering ~15,000 liters/kg (feed, drinking, and processing)</li>
                        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> ~4,300 liters/kg</li>
                        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> ~3,300 liters/kg</li>
                        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> ~1,000 liters per liter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        That single plate of biryani or burger? It could consume more water than what one person drinks
                        in <strong>half a year</strong>. And that’s just one meal.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>2. Water Use in Food Processing</h2>
                    <p>
                        The water story doesn’t end after harvest. Once crops and livestock are ready, they’re washed,
                        processed, cooled, and packaged and each step uses more water.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Orange Juice:</strong> ~560 liters per liter (growing, squeezing, bottling)</li>
                        <li><strong>Chocolate:</strong> ~17,000 liters per kg (mostly from water-intensive cocoa
                            farming)</li>
                        <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> ~18,000 liters per kg (water used to grow and wash beans)</li>
                        <li><strong>Wine:</strong> ~1,300 liters per liter (from vineyard to bottle)</li>
                        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> ~1,500–3,000 liters per kg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Your favorite treats? They're silently sipping water from sources that millions depend on.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>3. Why This Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        Agriculture alone accounts for <strong>70% of global freshwater withdrawals</strong>. And as the
                        global population rises, so does food demand and water pressure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But here’s the good news: <strong>awareness = action</strong>. Choosing less water-intensive
                        foods even a few times a week can help reduce demand.
